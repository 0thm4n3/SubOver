# SubOver

Subover is a Hostile Subdomain Takeover tool originally written in python but rewritten from scratch in Golang. Since it's redesign, it has been aimed with speed and efficiency in mind. Till date, SubOver detects 30+ services which is much more than any other tool out there. The tool uses Golang concurrency and hence is very fast. It can easily detect and report potential subdomain takeovers that exist. The list of potentially hijackable services is very comprehensive and it is what makes this tool so powerful.

## Installing

You need to have Golang installed on your machine. There are no additional requirements for this tool.

## FAQ
**Q:** What should my wordlist look like?

**A:** Your wordlist should include a list of subdomains you're checking and should look something like:
```
backend.example.com
something.someone.com
apo-setup.fxc.something.com
```

## Your tool sucks!

# TODO
